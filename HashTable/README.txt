Run the make command to compile the code, next type the 'make run' commmand to execute my program.

The initial hash table will be displayed on the terminal but since the program generates 1000 numbers, there
will be a lot of numbers on the screen, each number is grouped to its appropriate slot. The program will then ask for an integer input, adnd depending on the input the program will display that slot. The user can type
"10" to end the program, since its an infinte loop.
