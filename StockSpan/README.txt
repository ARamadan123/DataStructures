README:

There are 2 source files. First one is implemented using the brute force method and the second uses the stack  method to solve the span problem.

Too compile both source files type the "make" command. To run the brute force implementation type
"make bruteforce" which will start the program. To run the stack implementation type "make stack". Too clean upthe object files and executables type the "make clean" command.

When you run any of the 2 implementations. You will be prompted to type the size of the prices array. The 
program will then take user input to fill out the prices array, enter whatever integers you would like and fillthe array. Once the prices array has been filled the program will print out the results in the terminal.
