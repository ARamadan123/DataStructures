nQueens execution instructions:

I have included a make file in the folder I have submitted. Run the "make" command which will output an
executable named "nQueens". After running the executable, the user will prompted to input "n" which is the
size of the board. After inputting "n" the algorithm will run.

I have coded the algorithm to print the board every iteration of the loop to allow the user to trace the steps it took to complete it. The positions of the queens will also be formatted clearly at the end of the program.

Note: for n <= 3 , the program will give segmentation fault since no solutions exist.

Run the "make clean" command to get rid of the object and executable files.
